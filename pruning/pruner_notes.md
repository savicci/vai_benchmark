- ratio must increase every iteration
- sometimes increasing ratio will not make model sparser, gotta break here (no way to know how, pruning only logs to output pre and post pruning params)
- most networks can reduce 90% of their original size, then nothing happens if we further try, ratio is only guidance to pruner, not hard requirement
- fine tuning with iterative pruner takes lot of time if datasets are big since we're essentially retraining whole network
